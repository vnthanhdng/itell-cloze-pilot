{"passage_text":"# The Science of Climate Change\n\nClimate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing our planet today. Understanding the science behind this phenomenon is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate its impacts and adapt to a changing world.\n\n## The Greenhouse Effect\n\nAt its core, climate change is driven by the greenhouse effect—a natural process that has maintained Earth's temperature at levels conducive to life for millions of years. When solar radiation reaches Earth, some is reflected back into space, but most is absorbed and re-emitted as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap some of this heat, preventing it from escaping into space.\n\nThis natural greenhouse effect maintains Earth's average temperature at approximately a comfortable 15°C (59°F) rather than a frigid -18°C (0°F). However, human activities since the Industrial Revolution have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases, enhancing this effect and causing global temperatures to rise.\n\n## Evidence of Climate Change\n\nMultiple lines of evidence confirm that our climate is changing. Global temperature records show that the planet has warmed by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times. The warming trend is visible across land and ocean environments and throughout the atmosphere. Physical indicators include melting ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, and increasing ocean acidity.\n\nBiological systems also provide evidence, with observable changes in the timing of seasonal activities for plants and animals, shifts in species ranges, and alterations in population dynamics. These changes align with predictions based on our understanding of how ecosystems respond to temperature changes.\n\n## Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO₂) is the primary greenhouse gas driving current climate change. Before the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO₂ concentration remained relatively stable at around 280 parts per million (ppm) for thousands of years. Today, it exceeds 410 ppm—a level not experienced on Earth for millions of years.\n\nThis increase results primarily from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation, as well as from deforestation and other land-use changes. Other significant greenhouse gases include methane from agriculture and waste management, nitrous oxide from fertilizers, and various industrial chemicals.\n\n## Climate Models and Projections\n\nScientists use sophisticated computer models to understand climate systems and project future changes. These models incorporate fundamental physical principles governing atmospheric and oceanic circulation, energy transfer, and the carbon cycle. They have successfully reproduced observed temperature trends and other climate changes, validating their underlying physics.\n\nCurrent projections suggest that without significant emission reductions, global temperatures could rise by 2.7°C to 4.5°C by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. Such warming would have profound impacts on weather patterns, ecosystem function, food security, and human health.\n\n## Addressing Climate Change\n\nAddressing climate change requires both mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable changes). Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, preserving forests, and developing sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nThe international community has recognized the need for coordinated action through agreements like the Paris Accord, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Achieving these goals requires unprecedented cooperation across countries, industries, and communities worldwide.\n\nAs climate science continues to advance, our understanding of Earth's complex climate system deepens, providing clearer guidance for effective action. The challenge of climate change calls upon humanity to apply this knowledge with wisdom, urgency, and commitment to preserving a habitable planet for future generations.","num_gaps":10}
