The text delves into the concept of measurement, highlighting its application across different fields, including psychology, where it is often referred to as psychometrics. Measurement involves assigning scores to individuals to represent certain characteristics, which can be straightforward, like age or weight, or more complex, like psychological constructs such as extraversion or intelligence. Constructs, not directly observable, are measured through systematic procedures and operational definitions, often involving self-report, behavioral, or physiological measures. The text also discusses Stevens's four levels of ___________—nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio—that determine how scores are assigned and interpreted. Each level communicates varying degrees of quantitative information, guiding the statistical procedures that can be used with the data. These levels help in making meaningful comparisons and drawing conclusions from the measured data, emphasizing the importance of a true zero in ratio scales for making ratio-based statements.
