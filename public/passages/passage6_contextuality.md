In psychological research, generating a hypothesis involves identifying and operationally defining variables to enable measurement. Variables, which can be ____________ (like height) or categorical (like chosen major), vary across individuals or situations. Operational definitions transform abstract constructs, such as depression, into measurable entities, often using established _______ in the literature. Researchers must also _________ the population of interest, using representative samples to generalize findings. Sampling methods _______ simple random sampling and convenience sampling, though the latter may not be representative. Research can be experimental, manipulating independent _________ to determine causal relationships, or non-experimental, observing _________ as they naturally occur. Laboratory studies _____ high internal validity by controlling extraneous variables, while field studies _______ higher external validity by reflecting real-world settings. Despite challenges, careful design and control in experiments can enhance both ________ and external validity, allowing for meaningful ___________ about variable relationships.
