Any deviation to program content or required times must be approved by the business unit Area Section Head and documented on a KR-988, Training Program Waiver form. This waiver is used for extenuating circumstances and requests are considered by the Area Section Head on a case-by-case basis.

For a list of CRO training requirements, press control and click HERE. Refer to this document for specific minimum requirements that must be completed to become qualified on a console.

If an operator is unsuccessful in the CRO fundamentals course, they will be permitted to retake the course with STL approval. If an operator is unsuccessful a second time, the Area Section Head and Refinery Business Manager must recommend the operator for re-testing. The Operations PDC must support this recommendation before the operator is permitted to retest. A third failure may exclude the candidate from future consideration for a CRO position.

Operators must be qualified on field jobs associated with the console before beginning Post-CRO Fundamentals training.

The operator will be assigned a mentor/trainer/trainers who will work together as the operator begins to learn the dynamics of the control room operator job. Together they will review all Post-CRO Fundamentals requirements listed in the link above, then contact the Unit Field Trainer to begin their unit specific console training.  The UFT will provide a training folder and track the progress to ensure all training is complete within the time allotted. 

The console training team maintains and provides unit support with Honeywell simulators for the FCC, ISO I, Coker, Crude I, Sulfur SRU2/3 & SCOT and Yokogawa simulators for RDS, HCR, FPU, IDW, CCR/PSA, RSU, ISO II and Crude II. The use of these simulators during console operator training is required along with simulation exercise sheets. If no console simulator is available, training will be conducted using procedures and simulation sheets at the console or HO station without making changes to the process. 

Successfully completing a QRB is required for all console operators on the first console. All completed, original training paperwork, including the KR-981A and KR‑984A (QRB) must be forwarded to the LMS Specialist in L&D to receive electronic credit in LMS. The LMS Specialist will ensure documents are properly filed.  UFT’s will review and ensure all training has been completed and send package to LMS Specialist who will give credit in LMS and forward to central records. It is recommended the STL retain copies in the employee’s desk file. Failure to meet the outlined requirements or failure to complete training within the specified timeline in Table 9 below, will be handled by a Board of Review to address the specific deficiencies and to recommend a course of corrective action.

Table 7: FQO CRO Job Training Timeline

CROs and HOs who have maintained their console qualification must work a minimum of one 12-hour shift per quarter on each console, or complete one 10-hour session on the console simulator if available. (With STL approval HOs and CROs may complete the 12-hour shift while shadowing with a qualified CRO. This is due to process and DCS changes that may have occurred to ensure this training is completed in a safe manner). 

Console Simulators
Simulator training is offered weekly for refresher, unusual events, procedure reviews and CRO unit schools. 
Simulations Sheets and Procedure Reviews
It is highly recommended that ALL CROs complete a minimum of 4 simulation exercise sheets annually conducting procedure reviews using the console simulators or HO station without making changes to the process.

Refresher Examinations
Refresher examinations are required every three years and are designed to demonstrate the console operator’s knowledge of a specific job. Each console job has a refresher examination comprised of 25 to 40 questions. Each CRO must complete a refresher exam for each job on which they are qualified with a minimum passing score of 80%. If the CRO is unsuccessful, a Board of Review will be convened to address the specific deficiencies and to recommend a course of corrective action.

L&D offers a series of Console training enhancement courses including, Advanced Refinery Distillation Skills for advanced console operators. Space is limited and participants are chosen by area leadership. 

When a Qualified CRO is transferred to a different area within the refinery, the CRO must complete all the requirements specified in the outlines above for Fully Qualified Operators or as a Trainee before serving as a Qualified CRO in the new area.
