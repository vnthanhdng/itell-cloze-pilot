In psychological research, generating a hypothesis involves identifying and operationally defining variables to enable measurement. Variables, which can be ____________ (like height) or categorical (like ______ major), vary across individuals or situations. Operational definitions transform ________ constructs, such as depression, into measurable ________, often using established methods in the literature. Researchers must also _________ the population of interest, using representative samples to generalize findings. Sampling methods include simple random sampling and ___________ sampling, though the latter may not be representative. Research can be experimental, manipulating independent variables to _________ causal relationships, or non-experimental, observing variables as they naturally occur. Laboratory _______ offer high internal validity by controlling extraneous variables, while field studies provide higher external validity by reflecting real-world settings. Despite challenges, careful design and control in ___________ can enhance both internal and external validity, allowing for meaningful ___________ about variable relationships.
