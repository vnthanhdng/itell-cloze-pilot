The exploration of human behavior and the natural world has fueled scientific inquiry, with psychology leveraging this curiosity to build a knowledge base grounded in research. Science aims to describe, predict, and explain phenomena, with each goal requiring careful observation and analysis. In psychology, descriptions stem from detailed observations, such as understanding the conditions treated by medical _________ through patient surveys. The goal of prediction uses established relationships to forecast behaviors, like predicting pain management in medical _________ users. Finally, explanation seeks to uncover causal mechanisms, such as investigating how _________ alleviates pain, either through reducing inflammation or distress. Science continuously expands our understanding, revealing deeper insights into human behavior and the natural world.
