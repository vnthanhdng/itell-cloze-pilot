In psychological research, generating a hypothesis involves identifying and operationally defining variables to enable measurement. Variables, which can be quantitative (like height) or categorical (like chosen major), vary across individuals or situations. Operational definitions transform abstract constructs, such as depression, into measurable entities, often using established methods in the literature. Researchers must also determine the population of interest, using representative samples to generalize findings. ________ methods include simple random sampling and convenience sampling, though the latter may not be representative. Research can be experimental, manipulating independent _________ to determine causal relationships, or non-experimental, observing _________ as they naturally occur. Laboratory studies offer high internal ________ by controlling extraneous _________, while field studies provide higher external ________ by reflecting real-world settings. Despite challenges, careful design and control in experiments can enhance both internal and external ________, allowing for meaningful conclusions about variable relationships.
